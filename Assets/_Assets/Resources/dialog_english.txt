dialog_h_0_0=God, what a strange dream. I shouldn't have had a drink with 5satyrs5 yesterday.
dialog_h_0_1=...
dialog_h_0_2=And how much did I sleep? I need to go out and get some air.
dialog_s_0_0=Hmm, it looks like there was a landslide. I wonder if anything can split these stones?
dialog_s_0_1=So it looks like this path leads deep into the forest. Why do I have this unpleasant sensation in the spine?
dialog_s_0_2=Not that I had anything to fear after fighting the overgrown mushroom....
dialog_g_0=Hey, wakey-wakey, even the attack of the 2goblins did not wake you up.
dialog_g_1=What? 2Goblins2?
dialog_g_2=Yeah, you know, small, vicious and green. Sounds familiar?
dialog_g_3=Very funny, pal. When did it happen? Has anyone got hurt?
dialog_g_4=Before dawn, they hit us like a tornado - the guards on the bridge did not even have time to raise the alarm.
dialog_g_5=And, as you can see, there are plenty of victims. I don't even know if we can hold out if they attack again.
dialog_g_6=But 2goblins almost never leave their caves. What made them come out and attack us?
dialog_g_7=Who knows? Maybe they are tired of eating only mushrooms and moss?
dialog_g_8=Well, I don't have time to mess with you now. Find the 3Highest3, she was looking for you.
dialog_g_9=3Highest3? Where can I find her?
dialog_g_10=I think she is somewhere near a Tree in the center of the 3village3, you won't get lost.
dialog_h_0=Hello, my dear. Looks like you slept through all the fun.
dialog_h_1=Yes ... I just read the book till late. This happens to me all the time.
dialog_h_2=Commendable pursuit of knowledge! But do you already know what happened at night?
dialog_h_3=I heard about the attack of the 2goblins2. But ... why did they attack? This has never happened in the last ten years.
dialog_h_4=2Goblins really rarely go outside. And they almost always avoid other inhabitants of the forest.
dialog_h_5=I confess to you, I myself do not know what made them crawl out of their holes.
dialog_h_6=But I am absolutely sure that this is not just an attack by an inhospitable underground folk.
dialog_h_7=The whole forest is now ... as if not in itself. There is 1corruption in it.
dialog_h_8=1Corruption1?
dialog_h_9=It is difficult to explain and understand, but this feeling is everywhere. A little whisper here, a gnashing of fangs there.
dialog_h_10=Not only 2goblins2, all forest peoples began to behave differently. Even in our 3village3 you can see it. 
dialog_h_11=Where there used to be fun and laughter, now there are wary looks and distrust.
dialog_h_12=Something is poisoning this forest. Something poisons us all.
dialog_h_13=But what could it be?
dialog_h_14=Oh, my dear, this is exactly what you have to find out.
dialog_h_15=Wait, what? Me? Why me? 5Satyrs know this forest like the back of their hands, they will find the source of 1corruption faster than anyone.
dialog_h_16=I suspect that the reason may be laying far beyond our forest.
dialog_h_17=Plus, none of them can use 4magic4.
dialog_h_18=I’m not hinting at anything and I don’t want to point a finger ... but what about you?
dialog_h_19=Unfortunately, the 3village needs me too much now. The wounded have to be looked after and no one knows if the 2goblins will return tonight.
dialog_h_20=But I can't ... I have all sorts of things to do! Who will water my flower? And the package? I have a package to arrive tomorrow!
dialog_h_21=No, I definitely can't do it right now. Maybe in a week or two. Yes, let's go in three weeks?
dialog_h_22=Oh honey, if we had that much time ... But you seem to have misunderstood me.
dialog_h_23=Your journey, if you agree, will be long and very dangerous. None of us can make you go.
dialog_h_24=But now the 3village needs you. Its citizens need you.
dialog_h_25=Oh...
dialog_h_26=Damn you... Okay. I'll go save the 3village3, the forest and all that. Just tell me where to start.
dialog_h_27=Go deep into the forest and talk to its inhabitants.
dialog_h_28=If they all feel the same as I do, then they will tell you where the 1corruption is stronger. There will probably be a source.
dialog_h_29=Any last parting words?
dialog_h_30=Be careful. And come back soon.
dialog_0_8=Hmm, the 4crystal above looks interesting. Maybe we should break it?
dialog_0_9=Probably, this does not say anything good about me ...
dialog_2_0=Um...hi.
dialog_2_1=Hello. Are you coming from the 3village3? Are they still alive there?
dialog_2_2=Alive, although not all. Why you're asking? Do you know about the 2goblins attack?
dialog_2_3=You are not the only ones being annoyed by these 2greenskins2. Several of our traders said that they filled the entire forest.
dialog_2_4=This is a strange question, but do you know anything about the 1corruption in the forest that drives everyone crazy?
dialog_2_5=1Corruption1? No, this is the first time I've heard. Although the local 5mushrooms have really become very aggressive lately. But why - I don’t know.
dialog_2_6=Thanks for that too. And what are you doing?
dialog_2_7=Isn't it clear? I study this 4stone4. I just can't figure out how to split him - this magical aura of his prevents me.
dialog_2_8=What? Split?
dialog_2_9=Well, yeah, you didn't think I needed his 4magic4, did you? We 5dwarfs5 don't need all this 4magic 4stuff4.
dialog_2_10=I just want to rip it open with my pickaxe and see what valuable I can find inside. By the way, you can help me with this.
dialog_2_11=Yes, and with what?
dialog_2_12=You are used to all these 4magical 4things4. Activate the 4stone4, you will receive its power, I will receive what is inside. Deal?
dialog_m_0=Um...hi. You are...one of the 5mushrooms5, right?
dialog_m_1=Why are you here?!
dialog_m_2=You are not very nice, you could have introduced yourself first. I want to find the cause of the 1corruption that has swept the forest.
dialog_m_3=Do you know anything about this?
dialog_m_4=1Corruption ... oh yes, I know about it. It is you! You are the cause of all the misfortunes that befell my people!
dialog_m_5=We have lived here since time immemorial and everything collapsed when you, 5humans5, appeared here. You and your 4magic4.
dialog_m_6=Wait, you definitely have unverified information. We are not responsible for the 1corruption1, on the contrary, we are trying to find its source.
dialog_m_7=The second one spoke the same way. But he could not deceive me. Even in a different guise, I saw that inside - a deceitful human, like all of you.
dialog_m_8=Second? Who are you talking about?
dialog_m_9=It doesn't matter anymore. He was able to elude me, but I won't let you go. You will no longer disturb my people!
dialog_cat_0=Hello!
dialog_cat_1=Hello to you too...talking cat?
dialog_cat_2=You look too surprised for a witch. Never met talking cats?
dialog_cat_3=First, how do you know I'm a witch? Secondly, I really have not met.
dialog_cat_4=The ridiculous giant hat betrays you.
dialog_cat_5=Hey! You know? This is a great hat. You're just jealous because cats can't wear hats.
dialog_cat_6=Are you trying to convince me or yourself?
dialog_cat_7=Okay, you know, let's start over. My name is 3Jake3. And I'm not here just for no reason, but to help you.
dialog_cat_8=What a surprise. And how can you help me?
dialog_cat_9=The most valuable thing a cat can give to a non-cat is advice!
dialog_cat_10=I know you are looking for the source of the 1corruption1 that has plagued this forest. And I know where you should look for the answers.
dialog_cat_11=There are not many in these lands who could arrange such an attack. And one of them is a 1dark 1witch1.
dialog_cat_12=1Witch1? If any 1witch1 lived in this forest, we would certainly know about her.
dialog_cat_13=Perhaps only she is not in this forest. She dwells deep under the mines of 2goblins2.
dialog_cat_14=2Goblins2? So that's why they suddenly climbed out of their burrows!
dialog_cat_15=...but why are you telling me all this?
dialog_cat_16=I also live in this forest. I loved the way things were going and I would have preferred it to stay that way.
dialog_cat_17=So it's in my best interest, too, for someone to sort out this whole mess.
dialog_cat_18=Someone else but not you?
dialog_cat_19=Look at me! I would be glad to help with something else, but it's not a cat's business - to fight 1witches1.
dialog_cat_20=Okay, perhaps you're right. This whole situation fell on me too abruptly. Thank you for your help.
dialog_cat_21=Nothing, thank me the next time you meet. I have a feeling that we will meet again.
dialog_cat_22=3Jake3, what are you doing here? And you've somehow changed since our last meeting...
dialog_cat_23=I told you that we will meet again.
dialog_cat_24=And about this - do not pay attention. Just small metamorphoses from the power of 4Stone4.
dialog_cat_25=4Stone4? So you took it, the guard was talking about you!
dialog_cat_26=It turns out so. Although you really shouldn't have found out.
dialog_cat_27=I was hoping you wouldn't get out of the goblin caves, and instead that old hag told you everything.
dialog_cat_28=And when I found out about this, I decided that the guard would definitely stop you. One misunderstanding after another.
dialog_cat_29=But I don’t understand, why do you need all this?
dialog_cat_30=What, 4Stone4? He'll let me fix something. You see, I was not always the way you see me.
dialog_cat_31=I was once a human just like you. Well, not really, a little taller and with better taste in clothes.
dialog_cat_32=I was a scientist. Researcher. I have visited many lands before I got to where we are now.
dialog_cat_33=Once upon a time, an evil 1Queen1 lived in this castle, you already know. And one day we had a misunderstanding with her.
dialog_cat_34=She decided that I wanted to steal this beloved 4Stone4 of hers and, as punishment, turned me into this tailed creature.
dialog_cat_35=For decades I wandered through the forest in this guise, before the particles of my mind began to return to me.
dialog_cat_36=And then I found out that 1Queen1 is no more. It took another years to figure out what happened to the 4Stones4 and come up with a plan.
dialog_cat_37=Plan?
dialog_cat_38=Yes, a plan for getting back my humanity. I will collect all 4Stones4 and they will make me human again. I'll be myself again.
dialog_cat_39=But can't you see what's going on with the forest? This 4Stone4 drives everyone crazy!
dialog_cat_40=Yes, I admit it is a side effect of waking him up. I would be glad not to use it, but its the only option.
dialog_cat_41=Only option?! Just stop before it's too late!
dialog_cat_42=No. You don’t understand what this all means to me.
dialog_cat_43=If I have a chance, even a illusive hope, I must take advantage of it. And I will sacrifice anything if I have to.
dialog_cat_44=So please don't follow me. Leave these lands and live on.
dialog_cat_45=Because if we meet again, I'm not sure it will end well for you.
dialog_cat_46=Damn! Now I'll have to fly after the other 4Stones4 if I want to stop him.
dialog_cat_47=Oh, 3Jake3, what have you done ...
dialog_cat_48=... 
dialog_4_0=Hello, we met again!
dialog_4_1=Sorry?
dialog_4_2=We already met, there, at the 4magic 4stone4?
dialog_4_3=I don't know who it was, but definitely not me. Can't you distinguish one 5dwarf from another?
dialog_4_4=...
dialog_4_5=If you don’t buy anything from me yet, then I’ll definitely get angry.
dialog_4_6=What are you selling?
dialog_4_7=Oh, these are very valuable artifacts. Remnants of the old days when 4magic4 was everywhere.
dialog_4_8=The first is a 5shard 5of 5the 5forest 5heart5, if you combine it with three more, it will prolong your 5life5.
dialog_4_9=And this is a 4shard 4of 4the 4witch4 4soul4, together with three more, it will increase your 4magic 4abilities4.
dialog_4_10=Only shards? Where can I find the whole?
dialog_4_11=Most likely nowhere. And no one in their right mind would sell such a treasure.
dialog_4_12=And the fragments are scattered all over the world - in secluded corners of the forest and dark caves.
dialog_4_13=So what? Will you buy something?
dialog_b_0=So, let's see what we have here...
dialog_b_1=Sounds like someone else's notes...3J.Vanderwalt3...scientist and explorer of unknown lands.
dialog_b_2=Whoever he is, looks like this guy lived a hell of a long time. And I would love to learn more about the local lands.
dialog_b_4=...I arrived in these lands quite recently, but there was not a day that I did not find something amazing for myself!
dialog_b_5=This forest is really huge and bears the stamp of some kind of magic, even more ancient than centuries-old oaks.
dialog_b_6=The first people I met here were the forest people of intelligent 5mushrooms5, led by a 3Baron3.
dialog_b_7=3Baron is the first among equals. A great warrior who once long ago turned scattered tribes of 5mushrooms into a single people.
dialog_b_8=Despite the fact that 3Baron was once known as a mighty warrior, prudence and mercy are inherent in him.
dialog_b_9=He spent half of his long life trying to establish peace with all the other inhabitants of the forest.
dialog_b_10=...recently I noticed that a majestic castle can be seen from almost every point of the forest.
dialog_b_11=It seems that a certain ruler of this forest lives there, but the locals in every possible way avoid talking about this place.
dialog_b_12=Although no one will agree to take me there, but I will try to get to the castle.
dialog_b_13=Local prejudices cannot deter 1Sir 1J.Vanderwalt's curiosity!
dialog_b_14=After all - what could go wrong?
dialog_b_15=...i found my way to the castle. The inhabitants of the forest refused to help me, but the dwarves turned out to be much more accommodating.
dialog_b_16=Or more greedy. What is generally not so important - the only important thing is that now I know where to go.
dialog_b_17=However, there is some bad news. The path was not so easy and goes through the goblin caves.
dialog_b_18=Am I afraid? Of course not! Do I want to climb caves full of nasty 2goblins2? Also no.
dialog_b_19=But there's nothing to be done, 1J.Vanderwalt is not used to giving up on his plans!
dialog_b_20=Although the goblins turned out to be exactly what I imagined them to be - cruel and vicious, they managed to surprise me.
dialog_b_21=Wild tribes actually turned out to be quite an organized community with their own structure.
dialog_b_22=For every ten common stupid goblins, there is one shaman who is as intelligent as we are.
dialog_b_23=And i think this makes them even more dangerous.
dialog_b_24=...and so, I still got to the castle. And along the way I found out why everyone was so afraid to talk about this place.
dialog_b_25=It is called the 3Summer 3Castle, and the 3Queen rules over it and over all the 2Magic 2Forest2.
dialog_b_26=She is rumored to rule this land with a strong hand and almost never leaves the castle.
dialog_b_27=The locals fear of her more than anything else and try not to anger her.
dialog_b_28=I was able to sneak into the castle secretly, but I don’t even want to think about what would happen if I was caught here.
dialog_b_29=I managed to overhear a conversation of several inhabitants of the castle and they mentioned a certain 4Stone4.
dialog_b_30=Artifact? Weapon? Memorable souvenir? This is what I have to find out.
dialog_b_31=No, I certainly do not want to say at all that I am going to steal something here ...
dialog_b_32=... but I can't pass up the opportunity to study such an amusing thing?
dialog_b_33=Looks like I'm going to steal it after all.
dialog_f_0=Greetings! Where are we going?
dialog_f_1=Beg me pardon?
dialog_f_2=Oh, forgive me, I thought you are a client. I am a local 3flymaster3, very glad to meet you!
dialog_f_3=And concurrently, the proud owner of a whole barn of 4magic 4brooms4, of which only one flies...
dialog_f_4=That is, at least on one of these brooms, I can fly...anywhere?
dialog_f_5=Not really. You must concentrate and have a good picture of this place for the broom to understand where it needs to take you. 
dialog_f_6=So on it you will not be able to fly away somewhere where you have never been before.
dialog_f_7=But if you meet another 3flymaster3 on your journey, you can already return to our forest, if necessary. 
dialog_f_8=By the way, where are you going?
dialog_f_9=I don't even know how to explain ... Have you noticed anything strange in the forest lately?
dialog_f_10=Did someone become aggressive or just behave strangely?
dialog_f_11=I think I understand what you mean. The local 5mushrooms suddenly became obnoxious!
dialog_f_12=Previously, they constantly ran over to me in the evening for a glass or two.
dialog_f_13=And recently I just came up to say hello and you know what ?!
dialog_f_14=One of them hit me so hard that I almost flew out of my boots! And without any broom!
dialog_f_15=Hope 3Baron will deal with them!
dialog_f_16=3Baron3?
dialog_f_17=Yes, their leader. He's like an ordinary 5mushroom5, only bigger. You will definitely recognize him.
dialog_f_18=I'm not sure about this 3Baron3, but I just intend to figure out what's going on in our forest.
dialog_f_19=I hope you will! And when you find out what's going on here - hit them for me!
dialog_r_0=Well, it definitely looks like a descent to somewhere very deep.
dialog_r_1=I hope I won't break a leg...
dialog_5_0=What's that noise?
dialog_5_1=Gotcha, 1dark 1witch1! Now you will answer for your atrocities!
dialog_5_2=...
dialog_5_3=Who are you? And what are you doing in my cave?
dialog_5_4=Well ... I'm here to fight you and make you tell you how to defeat 1corruption1.
dialog_5_5=1Corruption1? I'm sorry, but what does this have to do with me?
dialog_5_6=Well, are you a 1dark 1witch1?
dialog_5_7=And this means that I am necessarily to blame for everything? Are you living in a fairy tale?
dialog_5_8=...
dialog_5_9=So you have nothing to do with it? What about the goblins? Didn't they go outside by your will?
dialog_5_10=By my will? Do I look like some kind of 2greenskin queen? Lord, no.
dialog_5_11=We just have mutually beneficial cooperation with them.
dialog_5_12=They bring me all kinds of herbs, mushrooms and roots, and also protect me from uninvited guests. Well, that was before you.
dialog_5_13=And in return I prepare them all sorts of potions for insomnia and other nonsense.
dialog_5_14=But why then did they suddenly become so angry? And the whole forest?
dialog_5_15=Have you ever heard of 3Summer 3Castle3?
dialog_5_16=3Summer 3Castle3? He's been in ruins for as long as I can remember.
dialog_5_17=Yes, but it wasn't always that way. Let me teach you a little history lesson.
dialog_5_18=Once upon a time in that castle lived 1Ancient 1Queen1, very strong and cruel.
dialog_5_19=She drew her strength from 4Stone4, which once fell from the sky. And he was her most important treasure.
dialog_5_20=Rumor has it that once some scientist climbed into the castle, having learned about the stone...
dialog_5_21=Wait, let me guess, she turned him into a frog?
dialog_5_22=May be. He entered the castle and has not been seen since.
dialog_5_23=And you think this 1Queen is to blame for everything?
dialog_5_24=No, I don’t think so, her reign ended a thousand years ago and since then 3Summer 3Castle has been empty.
dialog_5_25=But even though 1Queen is not, I think one of her 4Stones is still there.
dialog_5_26=Someone could have used it to send 1corruption to the forest!?
dialog_5_27=May be. 4Stone would have the strength to do this.
dialog_5_28=So, if you find the answers to your questions somewhere, then in the 3Summer 3Castle.
dialog_5_29=But you said there were several 4Stones?
dialog_5_30=Yes, there were three of them, as far as I know.
dialog_5_31=And they should all be in 3Castle3?
dialog_5_32=Oh no. The strength of the 4Stones was so great that even the 1Queen could not hold them together.
dialog_5_33=And where could the other two be?
dialog_5_34=I would argue that the second 4Stone is kept in 4Winter 4House - the place where 1Queen was born.
dialog_5_35=It is a castle in the midst of the cold and inhospitable 4Frozen 4Wastelands4.
dialog_5_36=What about the third 4Stone4...I'm not entirely sure, but I have one idea.
dialog_5_37=The last 4Stone is most likely hidden in 5Fire 5Fields5.
dialog_5_38=It is an area filled with fire and ash around an old volcano.
dialog_5_39=I don’t know if there was a 1Queen’s castle there, but there’s no better place to hide one of the stones.
dialog_5_40=To go somewhere again...And I was hoping that I had almost figured it out.
dialog_5_41=I can imagine your disappointment. By the way, one last question. Who sent you to me?
dialog_5_42=Some talking cat, called himself 3Jake3. Do you know each other?
dialog_5_43=Oh yes, for a very, very long time. There was always something wrong with this tailed beast, but I did not think that he will set me up.
dialog_5_44=So if I were you, I would not really trust him.
dialog_sk_0=Wow...I'll try to ignore your fearful look and still ask first...
dialog_sk_1=Are you the keeper of this place? And 4Stone4?
dialog_sk_2=Everything is correct. And since you know about 4Stone4, you know that you are not allowed to be here.
dialog_sk_3=But it looks like the stone is no longer here. And since you have nothing more to guard, then we need not be at enmity either, right?
dialog_sk_4=The 4Stone is gone and now I serve its new owner. And my job is to keep all the curious away from 3Castle3.
dialog_sk_5=Okay, listen, just tell me who your boss is and where is 4Stone4. And we will say goodbye, deal?
dialog_sk_6=Your curiosity has gone too far. Now I can't just let you go.
dialog_p_0=Well, here I am in the very heart of the forest. And where can I find someone locals?
dialog_p_1=It would be easier if I had simple instructions...
dialog_vm_0=And so, these are the 2Goblin 2Caves2? I expected something more impressive than just a hole in the ground.
dialog_vm_1=Does it always smell like this in here? Lord, if I was goblin, I would also run farther from here.
dialog_vm_2=Okay, the sooner I get to this witch, the less I will have to endure this smell.
dialog_gblns_0=And who is this with us? Hey brother, take a look.
dialog_gblns_1=It doesn't look like she's one of ours. Are you lost? If so, then you are out of luck.
dialog_gblns_2=You are just a couple of frail 2goblins2. We'll see who's out of luck here. Where is 1witch1?
dialog_gblns_3=1Witch1? Brother, do you know any 1witches1 here?
dialog_gblns_4=Let me think ... No, I don’t know, and I haven’t met any 1witch1.
dialog_gblns_5=Hmm, and then what should we do with our newly arrived guest?
dialog_gblns_6=Shall we fry her?
dialog_gblns_7=Boil?
dialog_gblns_8=Stew with mushrooms?
dialog_gblns_9=Let's ask her herself!
dialog_gblns_10=Great idea, brother! It will be very kind of us.
dialog_gblns_11=We give you the highest honor to choose how you will be prepared.
dialog_gblns_12=I don’t even know how to express how flattered I am. But I'll probably choose another option.
dialog_gblns_13=The one where you tell me where to find the 1witch1, and then crawl away from here until you are safe.
dialog_gblns_14=Why is she so rude to us?
dialog_gblns_15=I don’t know, brother. Looks like we're going to have to teach her a lesson of good manners.
dialog_w_0=God, whoever said it would be so cold in here ?!
dialog_w_1=Although, what was to be expected from a place called the 4Frozen 4Wastes4?
dialog_w_2=And who are you?
dialog_w_3=I...hic...live here.
dialog_w_4=Have you by any chance seen one cat here? Flying, with a nasty grin and a magic stone in his paws?
dialog_w_5=Everything...hic...maybe. He went further north. But if you want to follow him, you will have to pay for a pass.
dialog_w_6=For this info i want a couple of...hic...bottles of this wonderful...hic...ginger ale.
dialog_w_7=You know, I'm running out of patience, so I won't even try to resolve this peacefully.
dialog_w_8=Well...hic...as you wish.
dialog_w_9=Okay, okay, yours took. Just leave me...hic...alone and go on.
dialog_w_10=Now tell me, where did that cat go?
dialog_w_11=He something...hic...mumbled about the island and...hic...volcano.
dialog_w_12=And how do I get to this island? Swim?
dialog_w_13=I have a broom there, it...hic...will take you straight to the...hic...volcano.
dialog_w_14=Listen, maybe at least...hic...on the way back you can bring me a bottle or two?
dialog_w_15=Are you serious?
dialog_w_16=You know, this could be the beginning of a wonderful...hic...friendship.
dialog_vkn_0=Well, as everyone said, it’s a rather bleak place. And how did I get here from my cozy village?
dialog_vkn_1=Okay, it's pretty simple. Find 3Jake3, pick up the stones, dump home. What could go wrong?
dialog_vkn_2=Hey! Didn't expect to see 3flymaster here.
dialog_vkn_3=Greetings! Our missions are supposed to be on all the islands of the kingdom - so I was sent here.
dialog_vkn_4=How long have you been here?
dialog_vkn_5=For ten years already ... It's funny, in all ten years no one has ever flown here, but today, in the morning, two at once.
dialog_vkn_6=Let me guess, the first was the flying cat?
dialog_vkn_7=Yes exactly! Are you friends with him?
dialog_vkn_8=Something like that. Okay, since he's already here, then it's time for me to run. Cheer up here.
dialog_vkn_9=Nothing, in fifty years I should be replaced.
dialog_vkn_10=Hi ... There is a lot more people than I expected.
dialog_vkn_11=Where there are buyers, there will always be a 5dwarf with suitable goods!
dialog_vkn_12=And to whom are you going to sell something here? There is no one here.
dialog_vkn_13=Is it? You are here.
dialog_vkn_14=Well that's fair.
dialog_cstl_0=Brrrr, what a creepy place. And dusting around. Even my house is cleaner.
dialog_end_0=You are here, after all.
dialog_end_1=Of course, your offer was tempting, but how could I have missed that?
dialog_end_2=You won't give me the stones, will you?
dialog_end_3=No chance. I cannot back down, not now.
dialog_end_4=Then...shall we begin?
dialog_end_5=You will regret not taking my advice.
dialog_end_6=Oh 3Jake3, I didn't want it to end this way.
dialog_end_7=But now I can at least go home. This walk was too long.
dialog_tav_0=Wait what? Giant demonic cat head?
dialog_tav_1=No way, you must be kidding!
dialog_tav_2=I wouldn't have believed it myself, if someone had told me.
dialog_tav_3=And how did you beat him?
dialog_tav_4=It wasn't easy, but I had a couple more magic tricks up my sleeve.
dialog_tav_5=Well, it's cool...if it's all true.
dialog_tav_6=Hey, then why aren't we at your parade yet?
dialog_tav_7=Because no one believed me!	
dialog_tav_8=If I tell this to anyone other than 3Highest3, they just laugh at me!
dialog_tav_9=Well...we believed you.
dialog_tav_10=And thanks for that. But I am done with heroism.
dialog_tav_11=I think you're doing great.
dialog_tav_12=Yes! What should we do if another demonic cat appears?
dialog_tav_13=Your flattery will not help convince me.
dialog_tav_14=Yes? But what if the next bottle will be at my expense?
dialog_tav_15=...
dialog_tav_16=Bartender! We'll be here for a while longer.
